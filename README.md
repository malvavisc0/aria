## Introduction

Aria's **primary use case** is providing a **cost-effective way to run AI agents locally** for reasoning and task completion. It's **designed for AI enthusiasts** with some technical experience (e.g., familiarity with Docker and GPU acceleration) who want to avoid expensive model costs. .

## Agents

The [Agno framework](https://github.com/agno-agi/agno) enables agents to integrate memory, logic, and reasoning capabilities, and are assigned specific tasks, goals, and instructions.  This design allows for efficient operation with 8B parameter models, eliminating the need for larger, more resource-intensive models."

### üìö Chat Agent 

This agent excels at natural language conversation. It's designed for interactive dialogue, question answering, and general chat interactions. Very good for getting quick answers to questions, and simulating a conversation with an AI. Useful for iteratively refining ideas.

### üê¨ Reasoning Agent 

Built for logical reasoning and problem-solving. It can analyze information, draw conclusions, and identify potential solutions. Great for brainstorming, ideal for complex decision-making, troubleshooting issues, and exploring different scenarios. Can be used to evaluate the pros and cons of different approaches.

### üí∏ Finance Agent

Accesses real-time and historical stock prices, financial news, and key financial data points for a wide range of assets (stocks, ETFs, mutual funds, cryptocurrencies, etc.).

### üîç Wikipedia Agent

Specifically designed to search and retrieve information from Wikipedia. Quickly gather background information, verify facts, and expand your knowledge base on a wide range of topics.

### üë®‚Äç‚öïÔ∏è Medic Agent 

Focused on searching and extracting data from the [PubMed database](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), a comprehensive resource for biomedical literature. Essential for researchers and anyone working with medical or scientific topics. Quickly find relevant research papers, clinical trials, and other resources.

### üöÄ arXiv Agent

Dedicated to searching and retrieving information from [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/), a repository for pre-prints in physics, mathematics, computer science, and related fields. Stay up-to-date on the latest research, discover new approaches, and find inspiration for your own projects.

### üåê Researcher Agent

This agent orchestrates the other agents, leveraging their combined strengths to perform comprehensive research tasks. It can formulate search queries, gather information from multiple sources, and synthesize findings into a coherent report. Perform complex research projects efficiently, saving time and effort. Ideal for projects requiring a broad perspective and synthesis of information from diverse sources.
